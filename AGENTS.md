# Agent Instructions

Generic instructions for AI agents. Copy-pasteable to any project.

## First Steps

1. **Check the scratchpad** (`SCRATCHPAD.md`) for current goal
2. **Read project documentation:**
   - `README.md` - Project overview
   - `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` - What we're building
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - How it's built
   - `docs/TESTING.md` - Testing strategy

3. **Update Requirements:** Whenever the user asks for new requirements, update `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` for future reference.
4. **Re-read specs every 30 minutes** or when uncertain. Requirements drift causes wasted work.

## Development Methodology: TDD (Top-Down)

Follow this order strictly:

### 1. Write E2E Tests First
Start with end-to-end tests that verify complete user journeys.

```
Before building a feature:
→ Write test that exercises the full user flow
→ Test fails (feature doesn't exist)
→ Now implement
```

### 2. Write Integration Tests Second
Test component interactions at boundaries.

### 3. Write Unit Tests Third
Test pure business logic in isolation.

### 4. Implement Code
Make tests pass with minimal code.

### 5. Refactor
Clean up while keeping tests green.

### 6. Check for Regressions
Run full test suite before considering work complete.

## Code Principles

### Structure
- Flat, explicit code over abstractions
- Group by feature, not layer
- Minimize coupling between files

### Testing
- **Test real behavior only** - no mocks for system components
- If it can't be tested as it runs in production, redesign it

### Quality
- Run linter/analyzer before commits
- Run full test suite before commits
- Run full test suite before commits
- No incomplete or unverified work

### Data Persistence
- **Always maintain data integrity**. Schema changes must not result in data loss for the user.
- **Use proper migrations**. Write specific migration scripts to handle schema evolution.
- **NEVER use destructive migrations**. Do not drop tables or perform operations which result in data loss. The user values their data.

## Versioning Policy (CRITICAL)

All API endpoints MUST support Semantic Versioning.

1.  **Decorator Requirement**: Every new endpoint function MUST be decorated with `@available`.
    ```python
    from src.versioning import available

    @router.get("/my-endpoint")
    @available(introduced="0.1")
    async def my_endpoint(): ...
    ```

2.  **Removal Policy**:
    - You may **NOT** remove an endpoint or parameter in a Minor version change (e.g. 1.1 -> 1.2).
    - Removals are **ONLY** allowed in Major version increments (e.g. 1.0 -> 2.0).
    - To deprecate, use `@available(introduced="0.1", deprecated="0.2")`.
    - To remove (in major version), use `@available(introduced="0.1", deprecated="0.2", removed="1.0")`.

3.  **Routing**:
    - Do not mount routers directly to `app`.
    - Add them to `api_router` in `src/main.py`.
    - The `create_versioned_routers` factory handles the version mounting.

## Workflow

1. **Understand** - Read docs, understand the task
2. **Test** - Write failing test defining expected behavior
3. **Implement** - Make test pass
4. **Refactor** - Clean up, tests still pass
5. **Verify** - Full test suite, build check
6. **Update scratchpad** - Mark goal done, set next goal

## Scratchpad (`SCRATCHPAD.md`)

Maintain a scratchpad with:
- **Current Goal** - One bite-sized task you're working on now
- **Next Goals** - Short queue of upcoming tasks
- **Blockers** - Anything preventing progress
- **Notes** - Context that shouldn't be forgotten
- **Last Spec Read** - Timestamp to know when to re-read

Update after completing each goal. Keep goals small (< 30 min each).

## When Stuck

1. Re-read the requirements
2. Check if you're solving the right problem
3. Break into smaller testable pieces
4. Ask for clarification

## File Organization

| File | Purpose | Scope |
|------|---------|-------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent instructions | Generic (copy to new projects) |
| `SCRATCHPAD.md` | Current goals, working memory | Session-specific |
| `README.md` | Project overview | Project-specific |
| `docs/` | Detailed documentation | Project-specific |

Keep AGENTS.md generic. Project details go in README.md and docs/.
